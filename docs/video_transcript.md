- Hello everyone, 
- significance of imagination in learning.
- how minecraft is a great tool
- our solution - the Xducate toolbox . Making learning a cool experience

For the demo, we have created few blocks that will enable the educators and learners to explore the concept of graph search in computer science. Let's go ahead and explore few blocks and see how this works. First to start with we will need a playground which serves as an environment to perform all our experiments and simulations . So let us add the playground block into on-start block and this will create a simple arena with an agent and rose bush. The goal here is, the agent should to find rose bush and for the demo, let us use Strategy 3 defined here based on A-Star algorithm. When we execute, we can visualize how the agent is finding the goal and this helps us understand how the algorithm actually works. We have also created a tutorial where we have used a story to make these concepts fun to learn through simple steps. This tutorial can be found in the project links given below. Our project is open-source and is available on github to explore and contribute.

Thank you
